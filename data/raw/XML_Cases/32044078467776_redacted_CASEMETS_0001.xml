              <opinion type="majority">
                <author pgmap="13" id="b13-12">HOFFMAN, District Judge.</author>
                <p pgmap="13(112) 14(19)" id="b13-13">The facts in this case are not disputed, and the question presented to the court for decision is whether a seaman who had shipped for a voyage from this port to Ounalaska, in the territory of Alaska and back, had a right to refuse to per­form his ordinary duty, on the ground that such duty was required of him on a Sunday, notwithstanding that the day in question was not, by the custom and usage of the port of Ounalaska, where the vessel lay, observed as a Sunday or holiday. It is not disputed that according to our calendar the day was Sunday, but according to the calendar in use in the late Russian possessions on this continent, the day pre­vious had been observed as a Sunday or holiday.</p>
                <p pgmap="14" id="b14-4">The duty required of the seaman was to assist in discharg­ing the cargo. The contract of the libellant was in the ordi­nary form of shipping articles. These articles contain no agreement for exeinption from labor on the part of the crew on Sunday, or any other sacred day. But it is admitted that by usage and custom no labor is on that day exacted of sea­men, except such as is necessary for the navigation, and care of the ship, or such as may be rendered necessary by extra­ordinary circumstances.</p>
                <p pgmap="14" id="b14-5">Admitting, therefore, that this usage enters into, and forms a part of the contract, it is nevertheless apparent that from its very nature it can only give to the seaman the right to exemption from duty, subject to the discretion of the mas­ter. It is for the latter to determine what work is necessary, and when the labor of the crew or of any member of it is re­quired.</p>
                <p pgmap="14" id="b14-6">In cases of emergency, growing out of disaster or danger to the ship, the necessity for the labor of the crew may be ap­parent to all. But there are many occasions when the neces­sity or expediency of requiring their services may depend on circumstances known only to the master, and as to the force of which he alone can judge.</p>
                <p pgmap="14" id="b14-7">The right of a seaman to rest on Sunday from the labors of the week cannot be more sacred than his right to rest dur­ing a portion of each twenty-four hours from the labors of the day; and yet the master’s right to call all hands on deck, and, if in his judgment necessary, to deprive the crew of their watch below, cannot be questioned.</p>
                <p pgmap="14" id="b14-8">In all cases, obedience is the first duty of the seaman; and it is only when the command is clearly unlawful, or the duty exacted is plainly unreasonable and unnecessary, that a re­fusal to obey can be for a moment countenanced. In the case of Ulary v. The Washington, Fed.Cas.No. 14,323, Judge Hopkinson says: “The libellant contends that he was not bound to work on Sunday. There is no law for this po­sition. The nature of the service requires that the men should-do so, and they must not be allowed to set themselves up as judges, and refuse to do their duty on such excuses.”</p>
                <p pgmap="15" id="b15-3">In the case at bar, the order of the.master seems to have been reasonable and proper. By the usage of the port where the vessel lay, the day was a secular day, devoted to ordinary business and labor; and of this the seaman may be considered to have had notice when he entered into his con­tract. If by the law, or perhaps by the established usage of the port, labor had been prohibited on that day, he would have been entitled to the exemption. But certainly the mas­ter cannot be bound to accord to him all the privileges se­cured by the law or the usage of the port where the vessel is lying, and also all those allowed by the law and usage of the port from which she sailed. The contract for the seaman’s service contemplates its performance in part at the port of Ounalaska, and as to that part it must be performed accord­ing to the law and usage there prevailing.</p>
                <p pgmap="15" id="b15-4">It did not distinctly appear at the hearing whether the pre­vious day observed at Ounalaska as a holiday had been al­lowed to the seaman as a day of rest. It probably was; for the master would be unlikely to offend the sentiments of the inhabitants by a desecration of the day, and when all busi­ness and labor on shore were suspended, the discharge of the cargo by the crew would almost necessarily be interrupted.</p>
                <p pgmap="15" id="b15-5">The motives of the libellant in refusing to work are not shown. It does not appear what religion he professes, or even that he is a Christian. His refusal, therefore, cannot be attributed to scruples of conscience. He has chosen to stand on the purely legal ground that no work could be required of him on Sunday, except such as was clearly indispensable and necessary; and of this he constituted himself the judge.</p>
                <p pgmap="15(135) 16(64)" id="b15-6">My opinion is that the master had the right, under the cir­cumstances, to require of him the performance of his duty. As the seaman, when the alternative was distinctly presented to him, chose to leave the vessel rather than go to work, he must be regarded as having abandoned the service, and he can have no claim for wages which by his own act he was prevented from earning. But, at the same time, I con­sider that the master’s command to the seaman to go to work or to go ashore, was virtually an expulsion from the ship as a penalty or punishment for his refusal to do duty. Had the vessel been in a foreign port, this would have been clearly unlawful. It might even have exposed the master to a crim­inal prosecution. Ounalaska, though within our own terri­tory, is remote and not much frequented. The seaman’s re­fusal may have arisen from an honest mistake as to his rights and duties. I cannot affirm that conscientious scru­ples may not also have influenced him. His previous con­duct had been good. He made no objection to performing his duty on any other day.</p>
                <p pgmap="16" id="b16-3">The master could have compelled him to work by appro­priate punishment, or the threat of it, or he might have hired a man in his place, the expense of which, together with such deductions from his wages as the nature of his fault justi­fied, could have been charged to the seaman. I think he had no right to expel him from the vessel, certainly he had none to inflict that mode of punishment which is only allowable in extreme cases, and to impose in addition a forfeiture of the wages already earned. I think, therefore, that the libellant is entitled to recover the wages due him at the time he left the vessel.</p>
